    "### Command and Control Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Havoc is a modern and malleable post-exploitation command and control framework, created by [@C5pider](https://twitter.com/C5pider) and freely available on [GitHub/HavocFramework/Havoc](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its relative novelty and underground nature, Havoc is not yet widely recognized by the commercial security products, however, is widely acknowledged by the offensive security community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Havoc follows best practices of C2 operations, allowing to establish mature and robust C2 channels. An example of mature C2 architecture might look as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- <img src=\"malware_lab_files/img/c2_infra.png\" width=800> -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Sophisticated adversaries never expose their C2 servers directly to the Internet. Instead, they use C2 redirectors, which are front-facing servers that receive incoming traffic from agents and redirect it to the C2 server. Redirectors are ephemeral, usually hosted on cloud providers or compromised servers, are numerous, and can be easily replaced once detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the Havoc framework is the teamserver, that is responsible for managing agents, handling communication, and executing commands, and it is the only component that needs to be exposed to the Internet. To administer Havoc, Red Team Operator have to use graphical UI-based client to connect to C2 teamserver.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on C2 infrastructure setup and concepts, such a short- and long-hauls, etc., you can refer to the following arcticle: [Red Team Tutorial: Design and Setup of C2 Traffic Redirectors](https://ditrizna.medium.com/design-and-setup-of-c2-traffic-redirectors-ec3c11bd227d)."
